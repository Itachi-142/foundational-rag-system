# Foundational RAG System

A learning-focused implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built from scratch using Python.  
This project demonstrates how documents can be queried using semantic search and a local Large Language Model (LLM).

---

## Why this project?

Large Language Models cannot answer questions about private documents by default.  
RAG solves this by retrieving relevant document chunks and passing them as context to the LLM.

This project was built to deeply understand **how RAG works internally**, not just to use high-level libraries.

## What this project covers

- Document loading (PDF / TXT)
- Text chunking
- Simple embeddings generation
- Vector similarity search
- Context-based answer generation using a local LLM (Ollama)
